# Razor Email Template Activity

## Introduction
Razor Email Template Activity using Razor view engine to feasibly create mail content in effortless steps.
### Scope and Purpose
Razor Email Template Activity is an activity created for Uipath to generate HTML email body using Razor engine in a few handy and hassle-free steps. This activity gets .cshtml template file as input and provides the HTML content to be later sent as an email. Razor view engine is introduced in ASP.NET MVC 3. Razor supporting implemention of HTML views in web application has made the process quite user friendly . The ASP.NET team have had the great insight of making the Razor parser independent from ASP.NET which gives the user the liberty to use it outside of web applications to generate any type of document including HTML emails. Any mail sender activity, consisting of dynamically-generated HTML emails can be feasibly implemented and maintained By Razor as compared to the String.Replace() method we've all been using till date.
